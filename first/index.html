        <p>I finally found you my missing puzzle piece, I'm complete. We go deeper and harder than ever before. This is real so take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back. I can feel a phoenix inside of me. Your peacock, cock, cock your peacock. Peach-pink lips, yeah, everybody stares. Uh, She’s a beast. I call her Karma (come back). Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above. Be your teenage dream tonight. I do it all because I love you, I love you.

        </p>
        <p>You could've been the greatest. Baby, you're a firework. Unconditional, unconditionally. You're original, cannot be replaced. Damn I think I love her. You don't have to feel like a wasted space. I do it all because I love you, I love you. Be careful Try not to lead her on Shorty’s heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong. Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns.
